# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this website as a way to learn and practice my web development and version control skills. This way, I would be better prepared for the bootcamp. Through working on this project, I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I used HTML to create the content of the site, CSS to stylize the borders for the content, and JavaScript for additional functionality visible in the Chrome DevTools console. Finally, I pushed my code onto GitHub using Git commands on my Mac terminal.
